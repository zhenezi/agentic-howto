This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work — the key is intentionality, not intensity.

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions. Focus on high-impact moments.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth — gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows.

## What to Avoid

NEVER use:
- Overused font families: Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts as the primary face
- Clichéd color schemes: purple gradients on white backgrounds, generic SaaS blue
- Predictable layouts: three-column feature grid, centered hero with CTA button
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

## Implementation Rules

- Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision
- Produce real, working code — not mockups or lorem ipsum placeholders
- Use semantic HTML and maintain keyboard accessibility
- Apply `prefers-reduced-motion` media query for animations
- Test responsive behavior at common breakpoints

## Verification Gate

- [ ] Clear aesthetic direction chosen and executed consistently
- [ ] No generic AI design patterns used
- [ ] Code is functional and production-ready (no placeholder content)
- [ ] Responsive at common viewport sizes
- [ ] Keyboard navigable (focus states visible)
- [ ] Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
